            <h2>Ukraine migration trend from 2021-2024</h2>
            <p>In 2021, there could be observed the start of a migration wave and it was only the beginning and by February 2022, 
              what was a small wave became a tsunami, with millions of Ukrainian leaving their homeland, driven by an urgent need 
              for safety and stability, seeking refuge in foreign lands far from the turmoil engulfing their country. These charts 
              trace the journey from the subtle early signs in 2021 through to the explosive surge in migration witnessed in 2022, 
              capturing the stark reality of this dramatic period. As the data transitions into 2023 and the early months of 2024, 
              a noticable reduction in migration numbers can be observed. Nonetheless, it is critical to recognize that the migration 
              figures, despite their reduction, continue to exceed the levels recorded prior to the 2022 escalation. This persistently 
              elevated rate of displacement among Ukrainians indicates a continued. This sustained trend, as depicted in the comprehensive 
              chart combining data across the specified period, underscores the long-lasting impact of the initial crisis and suggests a 
              continued pattern of displacement and underscores the fact that the implications of such a massive upheaval are 
              far-reaching, affecting not just the immediate years following the crisis but potentially shaping migration trends 
              for years to come.</p>

          <h2>Migration from Ukraine in Europe territory</h2>
          <p>
            In this map, we focus on telling you why the number of Ukraine to Europe
            increased significantly in the late 2023 and early 2024. We will start in
            February 2022 when Russia begins to launch operations to take over Ukraine.
            Over the past 2 years, Ukraine's major cities have been seriously affected by
            the war and that is why Ukrainians have been supported by European governments
            to emigrate. Therefore, We created this map to help viewers can clearly visualize 
            the total number of Ukrainians who have migrated to Europe as of early 2024. As we 
            can see the map,all European countries have supported Ukrainian refugees very warmly
            and that number reaches 8 million Ukrainian refugees in the EU. Specially, Although 
            Russia is at war with Ukraine, the number of Ukrainians is living in Russia is up to 
            1.2 million people. To explain this, the only reason is that these people had settled 
            in Russia before the war so the parameters shown on the chart are completely accurate.

          <h2>Ukraine IDP Demographic 2022/2024</h2>
          <p>The data of Ukraine's internally displaced persons (IDPs) reveals notable patterns between 2022 and 2024. 
            In the age-group graph, there's an overall downward trend, with the most significant decrease seen in the Adult 
            category, dropping from approximately 3.2 million to 1.7 million. This might suggest that individuals in this age 
            group are often the most able to move, finding opportunities to settle or relocate elsewhere.  Meanwhile, the modest 
            reductions in the numbers of the very young and the elderly imply that these demographics may face greater challenges in 
            relocating or have limited opportunities available to them.
          </br>
          </br>
            The gender data of Ukraine's IDPs indicates that from 2022 to 2024, the number of displaced individuals of both genders 
            has decreased. Specifically, for males, the number went down from approximately 2.4 million to 1.3 million. 
            and 3.2 million to 2.1 million for female. This uniform decline suggests a 
            common set of factors influencing displacement, regardless of gender, such as improved conditions and assistance 
            from humanitarian organizations. Since the war has continued for two years, support systems are likely 
            well-established, enabling displaced people to return or settle. The consistent pattern of reduction across both 
            genders provides a clearer picture of the displacement trends in Ukraine, reflecting a general improvement in the 
            situation of IDPs over the two years observed.</p>
